Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to theUSA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment wasintended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.His colleague Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) spoke in opposition agreeing with committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.\"I would just point to the actual language in here\" Klobuchar said \"which is it\\'s not like this is some pie-in-the-sky standard here. I mean it specifically says\" she noted approvingly reading aloud from the bill that therehave to be \"reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized nationalsecurity investigation\" and you can\\'t investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there\\'s gotto be some suspected foreign agent involved.\"So I just for anyone listening to this it is not like there is no standard\" she concluded. \"There is a standard inplace here.\"\"That\\'s the standard that is in the bill now?\" Sessions asked.Klobuchar nodded that it was.No it\\'s not Durbin interrupted. \"Senator Klobuchar you just read my amendment\" not the bill he said -- \"and Ithink it\\'s critically important that you understand what we\\'re establishing here.\"Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment which got only a handful of votes anyway.Blame the gatekeeperThe usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day ofwork and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heedtheir expert advice. (They are by nature an optimistic crowd.)Then after 7 months 8 days and 12 hours on average the grumbling begins that the secretary is \"notaccessible\" to senior career folks that she\\'s overly protected by her personal staff that the promised \"opendoor\" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing usually at the secretary\\'s chief of staff. These days that\\'sCheryl Mills who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.We\\'re hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staffcounselor overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay not really) --has made entry to Clinton\\'s suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.Not so says Undersecretary of State William Burns the department\\'s top career official. \"This secretary is intouch every day with as many people across the department as possible and Cheryl is a big part of making thathappen.\"Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August andIreland and Moscow just the other day and soon she\\'ll be back on the road pretty much until Thanksgiving.There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.Hey just telling you what we\\'re hearing.In a timely fashion ...The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department\\'s personnel bureau. The bureauin an Oct. 13 notice said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West LafayetteInd. to \"assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have beenprofessionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatestpossibility of success in the foreign service.\"Well good thing the department\\'s only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.The rest of the résuméThe White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson a nuclear expertand senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group to be a member of theDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs even her undergraduate degree innuclear engineering.Name sounds familiar. Roberson Roberson: Wasn\\'t she Dubya\\'s appointee as assistant secretary of the EnergyDepartment for environmental management the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That\\'s notmentioned in the White House release but she was there from 2001 to 2004.Waterboarding for kids?WGDB Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal Sen.John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federaldeficits which are not for him an abstraction.\"It is deeply personal with me\" Coburn explained. \"I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes and I see thepotential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going towaterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to floodthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because wedon\\'t have the courage to make the difference for their future.\"Wait a minute! It\\'s just a dunk in the water.© 2009 The Washington Post Company\\nFraud: No'"

            "Text: -- Good evening,My name is Mr. Solomon Kaku, a banker here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith as a brother, believing that you will not betray me regarding the information I am about to reveal to you. In 2002 a Crude Oil dealer Late Mr. MICHAEL SCHMIDT, made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at US$14,600,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Six hundred Thousand US Dollars) with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of manager. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 20th of August 2005. I have tried my possible best to locate Mr. Michael to notify him about this, but all my efforts proved abortive. I later discovered that Mr. Michael, his wife and only daughter were among the victims of bomb blast during the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, he has no other living relatives to inherit this fund.Now, a new Financial Law, which takes effect in two month�s time, stipulates that any bank account more than $5,000,000.00 [Five Million US Dollars] will be investigated and the bank shall produce the account owner for clearance. This is a Government measure to check money laundering. If I do not find a way to move this money out of the country immediately, in two month�s time, it might be reverted to Government treasury because the bank management cannot provide Mr. Michael since he is now late. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account since you are a foreigner, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. It is only a foreigner can claim the funds in the account.  There is no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Let me know how much percent you will take, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message for further details. Please, treat as top secret, I am the only person having this information. Regards,Solomon Kaku.\n",

            "Text: My name is Mr. Edward Taibu, the stepson of Mr. Terry Ford of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address; I got it from the net. Don't be worried because I am contacting you in good faith. During the crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. Terry was one of the best farmers in thecountry and knowing that he did not support the President political ideology, the president supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments. Before this unpleasant incident, my mother and Terry had already visited South Africa to deposit the sum of Fifteen Million, Five HundredThousand United States Dollars (US$15.5M) in the safe vault of a Security and financial company here in Johannesburg  South Africa. This action was taken because Terry felt the growing tension on the farm issue but I guess he never anticipated the tragedy that brought his brutal and sudden death. At the time of deposition, the real content was not disclosed to the security officials; instead, it was deposited as Family Valuables? Valued for the real content in the consignment. After the bloody incident, we all had to escape out of our country for the safety of our lives. We seek refuge in South Africa and we were permitted to reside here as Political Refugees under section (5.9). Because of our present and unpleasant status, my mother and I are seriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of South Africa. If my proposition is considered, for assisting us to transfer this money to your country, we will offer you 25% of the total fund,75% will be for my family. We wish to invest a large portion of our share in your country under your supervision. For detailed information, you can contact me on my e-mail. I would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence. Your immediate response will be highly welcomed. I wait to hear from you. Be with God. Best Wishes, Edward Taibufor family \n",

Sharjah, United Arab Emirate UAEEmail:dongakabaka555@yahoo.comDear Sir/MadamYou may be surprised to receive this letter from mesince you do not know me personally. For the purposeof introduction, I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr.James Kabaka, a wealthy black farmer/politician inZimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in mycountry.The land problem, in our country came when ourPresident Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win hisre-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform whollyaffecting the rich white farmers and the black farmerswho are members of the opposition (MDC) party. Thisresulted in killings and mob action by Zimbabwean warveterans and some lunatics in the society. It isagainst this background that I and my immediate familyhad fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives andare currently staying in a country side ofUnited Arab Emirate. We are planning to leavethe country and seek political asylum in Europe and wehave decided to move our family wealth to Europe.We got your contact through the Internet based on oururgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreignpartner and hence decided to write to you. Before thedeath of my late father, he had taken me toUnited Aram Emirate several times and haddeposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twentymillion, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars),in one of the private security companies, as heforesaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money wasdeposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoidmuch demurrage from the security company. This amountwas meant for the purchase of new machines andchemicals for the Farms and the establishment of newfarms in Swaziland.As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with theresponsibility of seeking a genuine partner that couldassist us without the knowledge of my government whoare bent on taking everything we have got, and theUnited Arab Emirate seems to be playing alongwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving thisamount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of goingthrough the same experience in future.We are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust myfuture and that of my family in his/her hands. To thisend, we need your assistance to stand as theBeneficiary of the Consignments in Europe. This isbecause we are under restricted movement and watch andhence we want to be very careful in order not to losethis fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have asufficient CONTACT person at the Security Company inUnited Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europeunder DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company inEurope with your details as the Beneficiary. This is100% legal and will not pass through normalCustoms/Airport Screening.Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move thisfund out of UAE, you can contact me throughmy email address with your telephone, fax number andpersonal information to enable us discuss furtherdetails. I must let you know that this transaction isrisk free as far as we keep it as confidential aspossible. Thank you and many blessings to you.Yours Faithfully,Mr. Donga Kabaka.\n",

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of y=our integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to see=k for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laur=ent Nkono, the first son of&nbsp; Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular bla=ck farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my c=ountry.</DIV><DIV>This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe int=roduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and s=ome few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Z=imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of p=eople were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was o=ne of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fl=ed Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherla=nds where we are seeking political asylum.</DIV><DIV>Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to depo=sit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United S=tates dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the l=ooming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones t=o avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the= purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of =new farms in Swaziland. <BR>Now the family have decided to transfer my fath=er's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands= prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be invo=lved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Nether=lands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility= of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred= without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything w=e have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with the=m hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of S=outh Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as =you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessm=an, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of =my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk f=ree. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on m=y behalf to complete this transaction with you.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you accept =to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arra=ngements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from the=ir affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directi=ves for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.= But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of= ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement f=or the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Se=curity Company. <BR>I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to h=ave your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your accou=nt, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable invest=ment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, it is ope=ned for negotiation. <BR>I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all ki=nds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not =prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the re=maining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Please contact me as= soon a possible via the above email address,&nbsp; while I implore you to =maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.<BR></DIV><DIV>Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU </DIV><DIV>Yours Faithfully, <BR>George Nduumba. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><BR> <span style=3D'color:#000000;font-family:arial;= font-size:10pt;'>Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - S=ave =A37.50 a month <br><a href=3D'http://www.freeserve.com/anytime' style==3D'color:#0000FF; font-family:arial; font-size:10pt;' TARGET=3D'_blank'>ww=w.freeserve.com/anytime</a></span>------=_Part_18134_31113026.1074004880365--\n",

Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to theUSA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment wasintended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.His colleague Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) spoke in opposition agreeing with committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.\"I would just point to the actual language in here\" Klobuchar said \"which is it\\'s not like this is some pie-in-the-sky standard here. I mean it specifically says\" she noted approvingly reading aloud from the bill that therehave to be \"reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized nationalsecurity investigation\" and you can\\'t investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there\\'s gotto be some suspected foreign agent involved.\"So I just for anyone listening to this it is not like there is no standard\" she concluded. \"There is a standard inplace here.\"\"That\\'s the standard that is in the bill now?\" Sessions asked.Klobuchar nodded that it was.No it\\'s not Durbin interrupted. \"Senator Klobuchar you just read my amendment\" not the bill he said -- \"and Ithink it\\'s critically important that you understand what we\\'re establishing here.\"Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment which got only a handful of votes anyway.Blame the gatekeeperThe usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day ofwork and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heedtheir expert advice. (They are by nature an optimistic crowd.)Then after 7 months 8 days and 12 hours on average the grumbling begins that the secretary is \"notaccessible\" to senior career folks that she\\'s overly protected by her personal staff that the promised \"opendoor\" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing usually at the secretary\\'s chief of staff. These days that\\'sCheryl Mills who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.We\\'re hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staffcounselor overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay not really) --has made entry to Clinton\\'s suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.Not so says Undersecretary of State William Burns the department\\'s top career official. \"This secretary is intouch every day with as many people across the department as possible and Cheryl is a big part of making thathappen.\"Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August andIreland and Moscow just the other day and soon she\\'ll be back on the road pretty much until Thanksgiving.There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.Hey just telling you what we\\'re hearing.In a timely fashion ...The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department\\'s personnel bureau. The bureauin an Oct. 13 notice said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West LafayetteInd. to \"assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have beenprofessionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatestpossibility of success in the foreign service.\"Well good thing the department\\'s only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.The rest of the résuméThe White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson a nuclear expertand senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group to be a member of theDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs even her undergraduate degree innuclear engineering.Name sounds familiar. Roberson Roberson: Wasn\\'t she Dubya\\'s appointee as assistant secretary of the EnergyDepartment for environmental management the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That\\'s notmentioned in the White House release but she was there from 2001 to 2004.Waterboarding for kids?WGDB Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal Sen.John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federaldeficits which are not for him an abstraction.\"It is deeply personal with me\" Coburn explained. \"I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes and I see thepotential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going towaterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to floodthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because wedon\\'t have the courage to make the difference for their future.\"Wait a minute! It\\'s just a dunk in the water.© 2009 The Washington Post Company\\nFraud: No'}"

This however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour it against your will. I am Paul Kamara, 23 years old and the only son of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Kamara. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously during one of his business trips abroad on the 4th october. 2005. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just&nbsp;2 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 4th october, 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of&nbsp;nine million,&nbsp;one hundred and fifty&nbsp;thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.150,000) deposited in a bank here in Abidjan which he use my name as next of kin.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>He further told him that he deposited the money with my name as the next of kin, and finally told him to tell me where to find the documents of the deposit which he said was in possession of his lawyer in sealed documents held by him and asked me to collect it from him and all the necessary documents to this fund. I am just 23 years old and a first year university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.</DIV>  <DIV>Now I want a trust worthy person who can help me to transfer this money&nbsp; and provide an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.</DIV>  <DIV>Now permit me to ask these few questions:-</DIV>  <DIV>1. Can you honestly take me as your own and help me.</DIV>  <DIV>2. Can I completely trust you?</DIV>  <DIV>3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that i can forward the documents to you after we have agreed on the conditions for your assistance. My life is not safe here and i need to be out of here as soon as possible because now that my father is dead and with me only as a male child, my uncles will be seeking to kill me so that they can have all my fathers properties. i really don't want to struggle anything with them in terms of properties but my presence will still be disturbing them. thank God they are not aware of this fund in the bank hence, I want to leave here as soon as you help me to lodge it into&nbsp; a safe account in your stable country and then send me some amount to enable me prepare to meet you. Without your help, i will find it difficult to travel and transfer it myself alone with my little or no experience.</DIV>  <DIV>I am waiting for your urgent reply with your contact phone number so that i can give you the contact of the bank were my late father deposited this money <BR>for you to contact them as&nbsp; my late father's partner. <BR></DIV>  <DIV><BR>Thank you so much.<BR>My sincere regards<BR>Paul Kamara.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV><p>\t\t<hr size=1>New Yahoo!

He died in the ill-fated Executive Air Services EAS aircraft that =crashed at the Heipan airport near Jos, the Plateau state capital. My late =husband was close to the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the =Federal Republic of Nigeria and he enjoys regular largesse from the Head of =State as the Military Administrator of Kano State where the president came =from.Regularly, my late husband bags these largesse in local and foreign =currencies to his village (Wase) where they are stored in big trunk boxes in =his father Emir's palace.  These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my =late husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large =overhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all =the funds were transferred and stored there. The funds in the silos were top =secret between my late husband and his father whom he deceived into believing =that the money belong to General Sani Abacha, the then Head of State.  After my late husband's death in the ill-fated air craft on 7th January, 1997 =leaving his large fortune unprotected. The head of State General Sani Abacha =paid a condolence visit to the Emir, my late husband's father, the old man =believing that the fund in the silos belongs to the head of state and knowing =how brutal he was at that time informed the head of state of the money his =son has been keeping for him. He thanked the old man and ordered the money to =be moved to Aso Rock - Abuja (Government House at the Federal Capital =Territory). The money was removed with special army bullion vans in the most =bizarre manner that nothing was left for us (the family) to inherit. To us on =that day, it was like another river has emptied its water into the ocean.  =Our problems (me and my children) started from that day.I have just been informed by my late husband's attorney, our family attorney =Barrister I.K. Saggay, Principal Partner - Casefile & Co. that my late =husband operated secret domiciliary account with fictitious name in one of =the commercial banks and all the funds amounting to US$4.5 million has been =credited in his favour and I the widow was nominated as the next of kin as =stated in his WILL and last testament. He has now instructed me to seek in =confidence a foreign partner who will assist me in transferring the funds =abroad to secure the future and education of my children.In the light of the above, I would like you to contact me if you are =interested in this project so that I can direct you to our family attorney =who will furnish you with further details and the modalities on how the fund =can be wired to your bank account. You will be at liberty to negotiate a =commission for your assistance with our family attorney. On the contrary, if =this proposal does not meet your requirement or you are not interested, =please do not hesitate to inform us so that we can make an alternative =arrangement.Kind regards,Mrs. Comfort Usman WaseMrs_Comfort_Usmanwase@ciudad.com.ar       --0d507b99-262d-473c-9e12-cf016e4fdae0--\n",

            "Text: Just wanted to be sure you saw the Kurtzer op-ed which ran Sunday in the Post. Kudos to Jonathan Prince forgetting this written and placed.The Settlements Facts •By Daniel KurtzerSunday June 14 2009Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column\"The Settlements Myth\" is one example.Here are the facts: In 2003 the Israeli government accepted with some reservations the \"road map\" for peacewhich imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: \"GO! [Government of Israel] immediatelydismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report GOI freezes allsettlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).\"Today Israel maintains that three events -- namely draft understandings discussed in 2003 between PrimeMinister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush'sApril 14 2004 letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national securityadviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuingIsraeli building within the \"construction line\" of settlements. The problem is that there was no suchunderstanding.The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion thatconstruction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow buildingonly inside that line. This draft was never codified and no effort was made then to define the line around thebuilt-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading ofthese provisions probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.Second President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in whichIsrael would retain \"existing major Israeli population centers\" in the West Bank \"on the basis of mutuallyagreed changes. . . .\" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining somesettlements was predicated on there being an \"agreed outcome\" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention thatthis letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel Maale Adumim and GushEtzion the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these orother areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.In his 2004 letter to Rice Weissglas addressed the issue of the \"construction line\" saying that \"within theagreed principles of settlement activities an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definitionof the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria.\" However there never were any \"agreed principlesof settlement activities.\" Moreover the effort to define the \"construction line\" was never consummated: Israeland the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line ofsettlements. Weissglas's letter also promised \"continuous action\" to remove all the unauthorized outposts butIsrael removed almost none of them.Throughout this period the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days former senior Bushadministration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regardingcontinued settlement activity.Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the \"naturalgrowth\" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this \"means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies.\" This is nonsense. No onesuggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right tobuild more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis likeAmericans move all the time when life circumstances -- children jobs housing availability -- change.The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993when Israel signed the Oslo Accords Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116300 to 289600.The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152800 to more than 186000. This goes far beyond the naturalincrease of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of \"natural growth\" in officialdocuments started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 \"road map\" reflecting recognition that theconcept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuingpolicies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility ofachieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'responsibilities especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no\" way justify Israeli failure toimplement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freezeall settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.The writer US. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies atPrinceton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.\n",

I am writing youthis letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes outto the very powerful and distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate tohave worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years=..I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANKinside the philippines.In 2001, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the UnitedStates Of America and was on the verge of losing most of his estate to hi=svicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, myclient came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds,ten million two hundred thousand dollars(usd10.2m) to a fixed depositaccount in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about asthe confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection. Due t=ohis untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in theaccount ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we dosomething about it. This is where you come in.I located you through anagency that helps seek people by their email.my client did not declare an=ynext of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bankdeposit.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would likeyou as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that youwill be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we cancome out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare thenecessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to myclient.All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provideme with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence hisjob.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also filein for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letterof probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that wil=lbe provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all thenecessary documents.The allocation of our money will be as follows:20%(US$2.02M) to you for your part in this, 75% for me and my partners an=d5% for any unforeseeable expenses we may incur. I think this is extremelyfair, as you have nothing to lose but just a little time, while on theother hand I am staking my flawless reputation among other things. Andbesides $2.02 million is no pocket change. Once you are approved, theentire transaction should take no longer than twelve business days afterwhich we will go about our daily business, but just millions of dollarsricher.As you can see this is easier than taking candy from a baby but mind you,trust is something that is developed over time and that is something thatwe do not have. So I have to let you know that it will highly unfeasibleto try to run away with the money because even though only you cantransfer money in and out of your account, the transfer can only beauthorized by my department of which i happen to be thehead.The money wil=lbe transfered from my bank to an account you will provide. So please,there should be no room for greed because ten million two hundred thousan=ddollars can quench even the most insatiable desire for the almightydollar. Again, i will be in charge of everything else. I will assume allresponsibilities for this endeavor so you don=92t have to worry about anylegal ramifications, just what you will do with all that money.If interested,I would want you to send your reply to my private mail box:(m_socorro27@excite.com)Your urgent response is highly anticipated so please email me for moredetails on this transaction as soon as possible.This should be kept very secret and confidential=85 I believe you know.kind RegardsMrs. MRS MARIA SOCORRO esq(m_socorro27@excite.com)\n",

This money came about as a result of a contract executed on behalf of my Ministry, the (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing). This contract was officially assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of US$80,500,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost of US $63,500,000.00. Thus leaving the remaining US$17M to my benefits unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Ministry. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing his payment from my Ministry. It is however to this effect that I seek your maximum assistance and approval to present your company name alongside with the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign contractor to enable me transfer the difference(US$17M) into your account for further investment depending on your advice.

My intention of contacting you is to =solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. =Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, =the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza =from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was =an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the =year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a =brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer =and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in =millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you =the amount as we proceed).Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer =problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or =devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the =orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim =organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund =mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to =ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has =encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't =have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into =some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will =be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most =beneficent and the most merciful.

            "Text: ATTN: Dear Sir/M, I am Mr.Daniez  Philip. a consulting auditor of a Bank in West Africa in west africa. I have the courage to Crave indulgence for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in the future. Some years ago, an American Mining consultant/ contractor with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation,made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months, valued $42M.USD (FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account. On maturity, The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, The bank sent another reminder and finally his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore, made further investigation and discovered that the beneficiary was an immigrant from Jamaica and only recently obtained American citizenship. He did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paper work. This money total amount$42M.USD ( FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to Nigerian Banking policy, after some years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if the account owner is certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account abroad to facilitate the transfer of this money. This is simple, all you have to do is to OPEN an account anywhere in the world and send me its detail for me to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork, and facilitate the transfer.The money will then be paid into this Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35 % for you and 5% for expenses that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, and all the paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position and connections in the banks in Nigeria. This business transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase of the transfer will be ($4M.USD) FOUR MILLION DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the bank.If you are interested, please reply immediately through my personal email sending the following details: (1) Your Full Name/Address (2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number. Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest some of my share in your country. I look forward to your earliest reply. Yours, Mr.Daniez Philip\n",

A situation I have monitored closely with my position in the bank.Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years beforehis death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past two years plus, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\".I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for aforeigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handledby me and every loop holes sealed off.I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal.

He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife who is ina clinic there apparently.Empey still not on board apparently so the \"community confidence\" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That coupled withthe jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentarysupporting what we said seems to have made people realize that they couldn't lose the moment.\n",

I am (Trevor Gumel&nbsp; Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.<BR><BR>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in <FONT color=#bf00bf><U>(Monday 31st July 2000)</U></FONT> in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.<BR><BR>The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. <BR><BR>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. <BR><BR>You should contact me on my number <FONT color=#ff409f><U>00226-7885 75 97</U></FONT>&nbsp;immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequentdisbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the Banktreasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand asnext of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you asarranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin ofthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, yourprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication andlocation where in  the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text ofthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that thistransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom offear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail   through my adres   Your's faithfully  gef abey     ---------------------------------  The best gets better.

Since the death of my f=ather the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been tormenti=ng members of the Abachas family including family friends. All businesses= and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by the Governmen=t and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been frozen. A quic=k reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dol=lars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone throu=gh. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody,  t=he government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly spea=king I have been in detention since November 1999 and I was only released= on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgm=ent in my favor.During the reign of my father as the president of t=his country, an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was= revealed.

This account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I discovered that my late client&nbsp; died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. <br>The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde which crahsed on July 25th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next of kin. <br>No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account.</p><p>The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$16, 700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don&#39;t know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. </p><p>At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit to the both of us and its success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality.I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and  Resources, Offshore Payment Office Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification. Please, email me on receipt of this mail on ndlovu@phantomemail.comThank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.Yours Sincerely,Mr. Laurent Nkono\n",

            "Text: First Commercial Bank29 Wilson StreetLondon.EC2M 2SJDear Friend,I am Mr Thompson Rowe, the Head of Audit Department, First Commercial Bank, London, UK. And for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address listing. Please exercise some patience and read through my message. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Crude Oil Contractor with the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, Engr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a national of kuwait, made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months, value GBP12,500,000.00 (TWELVE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED  THOUSAND POUNDS) in my branch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform us that Engr. A Y Mustafa died on an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the kuwait embassy were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the Government of his country kuwait, and was consequently driven into exile. My proposal therefore is that, I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood  relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this means we transfer this money total GBP12.5M abroad for us to share. No one will ever come forward to claim it now, and according to British law,after 9 years, the money will automatically revert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, and certified dead, and there is no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation.The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!.Once you indicate your interest I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 14 working days the money total GBP12.5M will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Looking forward to your urgent reply.Yours truly, Mr.Thompson Rowe.\n",

Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales of diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.  My father lodged this money in a security company outside our country for security reasons and because of the political instability in my country.   My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before his death. He however deposited this money without any name rather, with coded numbers which is in my possession. With my father dead, my life was at great risk, I therefore had to leave my country under cover to Spain.  Now, I have decided to invest this money in a suitable and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek your assistance to transfer this money to your bank account for proper use. 20% of the total money will be yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure we might incur in the process while the balance will be for me.

            "Text:  For succinct introduction, I am Dr. Henry Salami of the above named Section of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN). The presidency has mandated the Audit Section to handle all foreign Contract awarded and commissioned since 1995 till date. Based on that your file has been forwarded to my office for review and subsequent payment to those contracts that was genuinely awarded and commissioned.Based on the review carried out on your claim, I discovered that the claim you are laying was grossly over-invoiced and inflated to that magnitude by some officials who contacted you to provide an account to receive the fund simply because the code of conduct bureau does not permit civil servants to run or operate foreign account. You are presented to receive the fund as the beneficiary. I have discovered that at no time did you execute any contract for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that you are contacted by some officials who presented you as the beneficiary just because Contract payment falls within their area of jurisdiction. Their aim is to divert the fund for you all to share mutually. I discovered and decided to contact you though you might find it difficult to believe but it is just the hard truth and so much money has been spent in these matter.  I am contacting you just for one reason that the fund can still be paid if I recommend because my discovery has not be revealled to anyone yet and I don't want to cancel the payment outrightly because it will not go down well with you. I want to let you know that the fund can be paid if you are ready to follow my advise and work secretly with me due to the fact that I have interest in the fund . I want to benefit from it, so let me know what will be my share out of it then I will go ahead and correct the anomalies and your past mistakes for the fund to be paid to you in seven working days.I am writing you with the spirit that you have seen that this is the truth but it will be very difficult to believe. As an Auditor attached to the Presidency, I am interested in the fund and I will like us to do the business together then I will write a favourable report about the claim for the immediate release of the fund or I will put up a report that will lead to the total cancellation of the payment. I know you have lost much money in Lobbying the officials to get the approvals.At the precise moment, the claim has been processed, we are irrevocably mandated to debit the Federal Government account.I will be expecting your call urgently on my direct No. +234 802 6944656 for us to discuss verbally for it might interest you to note that seven working day from the moment you acknowledge the receipt of this mail and agree on my terms will be enough to confirm the fund in your account provided you abide by my rules and also maintain the confidentiality of the transaction to avoid anything that will discredit my reputation.  I advice you discontinue any further communication with any other person for us to proceed in concrete fashion. Waiting for your response as a matter of urgency as the 2nd  Payment Quarter will come to end shortly. Do reconfirm your current telephone. It is  for effective communication.   Revert with utmost urgency.Thanks,  Yours faithfully, Dr. Henry  Salami.Auditor of  the Federation. (FGN)\n",

Before his death we are happy husband and wife Christian family. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was a live he deposited the sum of ( USD $1.Million ) (One Million U.S. Dollars)in the privet security company here in Cote d'Ivoire,This money still with the securyty company.     Recently, my Doctor told me that i have serious sickness which is Cadiac problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to your church or individual that will utilize this money according to God's direction.I want your church to use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.     The Bible made us to know that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don�t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don�t want my husband�s efforts to be used by self acclaimed Christians.      I don�t want in a way that this money will be used ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision to hand you over this Fund. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the hand of the Lord Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my problems and I shall hold my peace.      I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my straint. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Please do give urgent response to this mail without any delay.

            "Text:  Dr.Morgen Akin BestLagos-AfricaDear Friend,I, on behalf of my colleagues from the Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-one Million, five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) into your bank account. These funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet their financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to scrutinize all payments made to certain Foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which collectively left the sum of US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty-Five Million, five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.However, from our investigations, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this Opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transaction of this nature. We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank Account to be provided by a Reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because as serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$14m (Fourteen Million Dollars) into aUnited States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our foreign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share the money.As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner to see this matter to its logical conclusion, and until the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, we have cancelled further transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance and cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement when we reach the concluding stages of this transaction. We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sumin return for services/assistance rendered in successfully carrying out this project. We trust that you appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on our part, but when a Relationship is confidently established and operations commence you will be provided with all relevant information.I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail, for further information on the procedures and requirements of this transaction. In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always reach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and expediency.Yours faithfully,Dr.Morgen Akin Best\n",

My husband was the former President of D.R.C who was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards on 16th January 2001. At the mid term of this rebellion which is still on in my country, the younger brother of my husband, my son and I went out of Congo according to my husband�s instruction before his death because the fate of our country was yet to be decided. We came with sealed diplomatic baggage to South Africa. On arrival in South Africa, we sought for political asylum. We were not allowed to operate a Bank Account and I was so scared that I decided to deposit my baggage in a Security Company here in Johannesburg, because I wanted to be on a safer side, I told them that the baggage belongs to my foreign affiliate who is beneficiary of the item. Since then, I have been looking for a reliable and trust worthy person to help me transfer the content of my deposit (USD20, 000.000.00) (Twenty  Million United States Dollars) into a Foreign Account overseas prior to investment in any conducive country.30% of the total sum to you if you assist us in transferring this money to any of your Overseas Account.70% of the total sum will be for the family   investment in any country of which you will be a guide to us.Please should this meet your utmost consideration, contact my son George Kabila through his phone number +27-73-244-79-98 feel free to ask questions you consider necessary.

            "Text: to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services =20Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37 =20million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over =20(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made =20numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief =20operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, =20especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. =20We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, =20and however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with =20prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start =20by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 =20managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the =20money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our =20first months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included, =20stood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this =20margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk =20guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the =20money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment =20requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the =20funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that =20our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and =20in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a =209.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory =20charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I =20explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. =20Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the =20incidents of 9/11.I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in =20mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I =20followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds =20deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist =20private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and =20blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake =20transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly =20private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and =20well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was =20deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his =20arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication =20we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year, =20we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of =20that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I =20was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking =20sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not =20understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made =20futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating =20him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days =20later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, =20a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart =20attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather =20more information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank =20immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of =20kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his =20estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who =20patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels =20of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he =20listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an =20account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are =20rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the =20accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of =20having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring =20that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they =20nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not =20nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our =20care, in this case; he died in testate.In line with our internal processes for account holders who have =20passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to =20determine who should have right to claim the estate, this =20investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every =20continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to =20get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted =20in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being =20as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the =20estate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the =20deceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to =20supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results =20of the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I =20have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known =20or identifiable family member.This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the =20prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late =20beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by =20the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of =20claim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most =20probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the =20money entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be =20out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. =20This will not happen if I have my way.What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice =20but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the =20banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world =20aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with =20huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain =20portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general =20direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I =20alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no =20one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of =20this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the =20transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds =20to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are =20just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single =20idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply =20awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes =20forward, and this is the situation.This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family =20of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no =20family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; =20I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm =20to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon =20\n",

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Indigene cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.Your percentage will be declared to you as soon as you indicate your interest. I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated once you have agreed to get this fund transferred through your account.Therefore, to enable the immediate move of this fund to you arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating.1. Your full name and address2. Your telephone and fax number for easy communication.3. Your company's name and address.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the movement of the money.\n",

When my late husband wasalive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five HundredThousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management justwrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release ofthis money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody toreceive it on my behalf if I can not come over.Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoingtreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talkand my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It ismy last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the World.Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth sincemy illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this hugeresponsibility to any of them.Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Standand collect the Funds from the Bank.I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fundchurches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and toensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inheritthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't wantmy husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodlymanner.Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid ofdeath hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be inthe bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall holdmy peace.I don't need any telephone communication in this regardbecause of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's relativesaround me always. I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact ofAttorney who is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in layingclaims for this funds.Please send all emails to :mothermrsmelissa1@yahoo.gr=20Yours in Christ,=20Melissa Pointer=20God bless you\n",

I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in= African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist sear=ch.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability a=nd reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God= or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ =15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account= that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his enti=re family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next= of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unl=ess somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as= indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that al=l his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the pla=ne crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and r=elease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased fo=r safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we= don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained= unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank tr=easury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this= business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, an=d a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in r=espect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for =expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woma=n colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursementaccording to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arrang=ed, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the d=eceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private= telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=on where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=f the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this trans=action is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear a=s all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon= as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your's faithfully, BALA TOMSON (Esq.)\n",

Without these sections the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in eachsection.I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq inhis overview too.CdmLeadership Learning RetreatDepartment of StateBlair HouseOctober 2 2009Notional Timeline8:00am:8:30am:8:35am:Continental BreakfastOverview and Strategic Objectives for Retreat [CDM]Foreign Policy in the Obama Administration [HRC]o Prioritieso Our Accomplishments To Date8:50am The Next 6 Months• On the Horizon (including Iraq/Iran) [Jim Steinberg] [10 min]• The 2011 Budget Challenge [Jack Lew] [10 min]• QDDR: Restoring Diplomacy/Elevating Dev [10 min]o Presentation by Anne Marie Slaughter/Alonzo Fulgham• USUN — The Future and Multilaterism [TBC]9:25am: Ask the Secretary: Questions and Answers [30 minutes]10:00am: Urgent Threats Panelo Middle East — George Mitchell [7 min]o Af/Pak — Richard Holbrooke [7 min]o North Korea — Steve Bosworth [7 min]o Q & A [20 min]10:45am Coffee Break11:00am Around the World Department and USAID Priorities• Top 3 Priorities for Each Bureau/Dept — List Style• 3 minutes each• [USAID USUN SES(Gration) E PM ECA IIP PA M CA DS FSI HR GDRL OES PRM G/TIP]12:00: Lunch• Lunch Presentation at 12:20pm• Presenter: Alec Ross — 21' Century Statecraft [10 min]1:00pm: Partnering for Success — Paradigms and Pitfalls• Overview by Maria Otera• Breakout into 4 Groups of 15 with facilitator and note-taker [40 min]• Whole of State/USAID/MCC Approach — How Should this Occur• Partnering and Leading Through the Interagency• Regional and Functional Bureaus — How Can They Connect• In-Country USG Coordination — What is the Paradigm?2:00pm Presentation of Working Group Findings• Presentation by Group Facilitator (or Other) of Lessons and Best Practices [5 min pergroup]o Whole of State/USAID/MCCo Partnering and Leading Through the Interagencyo Regional and Functional Bureaus — Ensuring Connectionso In-Country USG Coordination — the Art of the Possible?• Q/A to each group [25 min]2:45pm Coffee Break3:00pm Transnational Challenges:• Non-Proliferation — Ellen Tauscher [5 min]3:45pm:• Climate Change — Todd Stern [5 min]• Global Health — Dana/Gloria [5 min]• Global Hunger & Food Security — Moore [5 min]• Questions and Answers [20 min]Around the World Department and USAID Priorities• Top 3 Priorities for Each Bureau/Dept — List Style• 3 Minute presentations• [AF EUR EAP NEA SCA WHA IO INL SR/PPP SR/ME INR H CPROCR CT GAGGWI .IEC CRS WCI]5:15pm: The Challenges on the Horizon [HRC]• HRC expresses appreciation for work done today• Outlines the Challenges Ahead• Seeks Investment and Commits to Follow-Up5:30pm Retreat Concludes\n",

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respectiveroles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clintonfor proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORKSECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTONSpeaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:\"After years of war and uncertainty people are wondering what the future holds at home and abroad. So let me sayit clearly: The United States can must and will lead in this new century.\"Ironically two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president andthe ex-would-be-president the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.Except that these days both Clintons are more influential and more beloved than ever. Bill's Clinton GlobalInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itselfbringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based technocraticsolutions. As of this summer his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort torebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president and hespent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.Meanwhile Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States anaccolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin'stemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions promoting women's rights over theobjections of entrenched traditionalists and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world'spoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence with her Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review a major if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this iswhat Clinton nostalgia looks like bring it on.74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughterfor setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTONBarack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how theUnited States deals with its allies and enemies abroad and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes felllargely to two people in particular. At the State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter director of policy planning isspearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenatemarginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development preparing for a world inwhich America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy co-founder of the Center for a NewAmerican Security think tank who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that bothcandidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's ownquadrennial review a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediateneeds posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistanstrategy albeit a pragmatic one: \"I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy\" she toldthe Senate in February. \"We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.\"Anne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Dept(silent of State(202) 647-2972\n",

Calm is not cavalier which you weren'tSecond you're not the EPA administrator or Interior Secretary - nobody will see you as a front line cabinet officer on thisThird if this is still out of control on Sunday the administration has bigger problemsSo I'm really not worried.Here it is again which might allay your concernsSECRETARY CLINTON: Well David I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this —Homeland Security Interior Environmental Protection Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible tomitigate the effects of this spill but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of businesshowever is to try to get this spill under control which has been as you know very difficult and to prevent furtherdamage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which thePresident has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential ofdrilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen ourdependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollarscleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas it's going to require a balancing act.\n",

            "Text: HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONK KONG.Dear Sir, Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S! o, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 10 months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at GNN Broadcasting Powered Site- http://labine.com\n",

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of y=our integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to see=k for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laur=ent Nkono, the first son of&nbsp; Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular bla=ck farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my c=ountry.</DIV><DIV>This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe int=roduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and s=ome few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Z=imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of p=eople were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was o=ne of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fl=ed Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherla=nds where we are seeking political asylum.</DIV><DIV>Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to depo=sit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United S=tates dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the l=ooming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones t=o avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the= purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of =new farms in Swaziland. <BR>Now the family have decided to transfer my fath=er's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands= prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be invo=lved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Nether=lands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility= of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred= without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything w=e have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with the=m hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of S=outh Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as =you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessm=an, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of =my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk f=ree. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on m=y behalf to complete this transaction with you.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you accept =to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arra=ngements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from the=ir affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directi=ves for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.= But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of= ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement f=or the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Se=curity Company. <BR>I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to h=ave your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your accou=nt, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable invest=ment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, it is ope=ned for negotiation. <BR>I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all ki=nds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not =prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the re=maining 80% will be for my investment in your country.

            "Text: HRC: Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.Unfortunately they give it a horrible title but I think the piece turned out alright.Best SandyBy Samuel R. BergerSamuel R. Berger chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group served as national security advisor toPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.President Obama's National Security Strategy released by the White House on Thursday tackles a delicate butunavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home anda reordering of political power abroad?For some time now it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. TheSeptember 11 attacks global economic crisis cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulfunderscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America'smilitary supremacy is certainly not at risk new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club ofpowerful nations to the G-20 which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costsand benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats withoutothers nor should we bear the burden alone.Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience these congressionally mandated documents can easily becomelaborious and impenetrable or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge which President Clinton insisted upon tome and his other advisers is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informsadministration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action but a means to convey thepresident's principles and priorities.In Obama's case the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks withpast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclearproliferation terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscalburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America the administration makes a case for economicand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Pointspeech last weekend. \"At no time in human history\" he said \"has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintainedits military and political primacy.\"Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia thepresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening aglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effortstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.On terrorism the strategy builds on the past but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton Bush and Obama each havedeployed all of America's tools: military power homeland defense law enforcement sanctions intelligence andvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the GlobalWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. \"This is not a global war against a tactic- terrorism - or a religion - Islam\" the new strategy says. \"We are at war with a specific network al-Qaeda and itsterrorist affiliates.\"This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world ensures the support of key allies who never accepted thebroader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan andturn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor the Obama administration has restored aless provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy President Bush articulated therationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores theprinciples that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort should weigh all thecosts and benefits and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right toact unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton oftendescribed as \"together where possible alone where necessary.\"President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. ThePresident sets forth his rationale: \"to create opportunities to resolve differences strengthen the internationalcommunity's support for our actions learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes and plainly demonstrateto the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.\"In the case of Iran Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage havehelped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal tonegotiate.Without a doubt there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal ofdoubling exports in the next five years it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea Panama andColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress but many of the true tests of this strategy lieahead.In the strategy's conclusions the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era calling for both political parties torestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despitethe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control Central America and détente nearly all American supportedthe containment of communism.In that same spirit the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out ourdifferences over detention of prisoners methods to disarm dangerous states how hard to push for democratic rights orthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goalsspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeedingin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order ofenlightened self-interest economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.\n",

I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us. In my Bank we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8 MILLION in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/thom02.shtml http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our Watchword in this transaction. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard.Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized.

            "Text: Compliments of the day, My name is Paul Jacksoncole, I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company. The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.

            "Text:                    Dear Friend In Christ, I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life. My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed. My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster. My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you. Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me. I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing. As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly. I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today.\n",

I am contacting you with regard to transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that atransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.PROPOSITION;I am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.htmlSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accidenthimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills andthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Pleaseacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. We shall be compensating you with 25% on final conclusion of this project, we have set aside 5% for expenses and 70% shall be for my colleagues and I.I intend to retire after the conclusion of thistransaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endevour to contact me immediately.

            "Text: Mrs.Rose ObasekiFlat 8 Block 12 NNPC QuartersGarki Abuja Nigeria.Dear  Friend,I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, butasthings unfold, we will know each other better. I will startbyintroducing myself to you.I am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson GraciousObaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,Nigerian NationalPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that youwill be of agood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.For many years of marriage now between me and my husband, Ihavenot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.As a result of the respect given to local tradition culture and customhere in Nigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. Withthe situation of thingswith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am beenthreatened dailyby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband sbrothers are notleft outin this matter. This situation has really affected me psychologically.As at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,hence I seekyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a longway in getting me settled finally.I want to use this opportunity to move the sum of(US$29.5M) intoyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in yourcountry. Thissaid amount was given to my husband as gratification fromsome Foreign OilCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drillingof Crude Oilin Nigeria.As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hencehegave me this money to keep in my personal account so thathe can beexonerated from the eyes of government security operativesand the Civil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body thatscrutinizes the activities of allcivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances forofficialmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connectedwith drugs; money laundry,firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in youto render the required assistance needed from you and consequentlywithdrawing your help forsecurity reasons.Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.This money was deposited in my personalin name, andthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically underthe bankingprocedures which could have been the easiest, but becauseof monetarytransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,that isdefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to movethis money out in cash to anydestination where it will be easy for you to collect underdiplomaticimmunity.This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your responseandwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish youon the next line ofacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transactionis 100% risk free,and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will notlike to puthimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, hestands thechange of loosing his job.As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm tomethat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you upthere in your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. Iwill be offering you 25% of this money for all your help at this time ofneed, while somepercentages has been  set aside for my Brother tocomplement his efforts here. Beinformed that this transaction will not last more than 14working daysand it will be concluded because every arrangement has beenput in place.Your negative or positive response will be highlyappreciated.Yours faithfully,Mrs. Rose Obaseki ___________________________________________ Look Good, Feel Good www.healthiest.co.za\n",

Its revival is testimony to the increasedchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.In the past week North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok or \"our nation.\"Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named \"uriminzokkiri.\" The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea a propaganda agency inPyongyang.Lee Jong-joo a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul said \"It is clear that these accounts carry the samepropaganda as the North's official news media but we have not been able to find out who operates them.\"The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korearesumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships killing 46sailors.North Korea which denies involvement has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter andYouTube with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outsideworld.)\"YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda\" said Paik Hak-soon an analyst at SjongInstitute. \"But fundamentally it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash outdesperately in the face of mounting international pressure.\"During the cold war era South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years agoduring the brief era of its \"sunshine policy\" of engaging the North the South allowed its people access to North KoreanWeb sites. But today when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account agovernment warning against \"illegal content\" pops up.These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their ownopinions about the totalitarian North.But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinkingof the South Korean warship including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in theSouth.The Twitter account which provides links to the North Korean Web site had 928 followers as of Monday. But a fewYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.In one such clip North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan the South Korean foreign minister who recently criticized \"pro-North Korean youths\" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections saying \"If they like the North so muchthey should go and live under Kim Jong-il.\"The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a \"pro-American flunky\" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living \"mopping the floor of thePentagon.\"Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the \"American imperialists\" because it was armedwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche or ideology of \"self-reliance\"; and because of a philosophicaltreatise written by Kim II-sung the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il who died in 1994.\"I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans\" said Yoo Ho-yeolan expert on North Korea at Korea University here. \"People watch this for fun not to be influenced.\"\n",

My intention of contacting youis to solicit your assistance for a project, which will be mutuallybeneficial. Though I know my decision to contact you is to a largeextent unconventional, the prevailing circumstances necessitated myaction. I am Muayed Abdul Faisal. I am son to Late Mallam MustafaAbdul Faisal of blessed memory was an oil explorer in Libya andKuwait for twelve years before hedied in the year 2000. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battlingwith both Cancer problems.When my late Father was alive he made a huge deposit in millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you the amount as we proceed).Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due tocancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known mycondition I decided to donate this fund to either aMuslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilizethis money the way I am going to instruct herein. My parents died at atender age and i was brought up in the orphanage through the help ofa devouted muslim.I want this Muslim organization or individual to usethis money in all sincerity to fund mosques, orphanages, widows, andalso propagatingthe word of ALLAH and to ensure that the societyupholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and thishasencouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because Idon't have any child that will inherit this money and my relativesare into some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation wherethis money will be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons forthis bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH themost beneficent andthe most merciful. I don't need any telephonecommunication in this regard because of my health, because of thepresence of my relatives around me always. I don't want them to knowabout this development. With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon asI receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of theDeposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will alsoissue a letter ofauthority to the Deposit Company authorizing themthat the said fund have being willed to you and a copy of suchauthorization will be forwarded to you. I want you and theMuslimcommunity where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness isthat I lived a true devoted Muslims worthy of emulation,Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and infairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, asit will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level ofinvolvement.Please always beprayerful all through your life. Any delay in yourreply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or adevoted Muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email,my dreams will rest squarely on your Shoulders. May the AlmightyALLAH continue to guide and protect you.WasalaamMuayed Abdul Faisal,\n",

I'm  21years old and a high school leaving certificate holder and the only  daugther of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Bien .   Firstly, my father was a highly reputable bussiness magnate-(a cocoa merchant) who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Feb. 2005.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth!      My mother died when I was just 11 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a sum of $10.5 million US DOLLARS (Ten million five hundred thousand USD)deposited in  Security Company  here in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.     He also said he used my name to Deposit the fund with the Bank as his only daughter, as well as the next of kin to the fund. He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business assocaites, That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money to and use it for investment purposes.     I want you to assist me in clearing this fund into your account overseas as a beneficiary of the fund,and also use it for an investment purpose.      Really I don't know what to do. Now I want you help me so  I can transfer this funds. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life, Presently I'm in Abidjan.     Dearest one,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.     Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me? 2. Can I completely trust you? 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is retrived?      Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.  Expect to hear from you soonest.     Thank you so much.Yours in Love,Sussan Bien       ---------------------------------Ask a question on any topic and get answers from real people. Go to Yahoo! Answers. \n",

            "Text: Hello,I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up. This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.     \n",

As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact through international business enquiry on internet.I believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directiveseeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request as it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills etc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either in your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.Yours faithfully,MR OMARU AMINU._________________________________________________________________Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

            "Text: Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten millions United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several Notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Ten millions United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the England Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MAJOR FADI EL AMIN so that you will be able to receive his funds.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please let me know and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\n",

Then after the death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic of South Africawhere he had deposited the money in the Security Company as family valuables.So, I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any bank account within South Africa.

I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe.Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you.please reply me through my private email;<martinez4charity@yahoo.com>Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.Mrs Ruthanne Ruby Martinez.___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site- http://yoursite.com\n",

            "Text: Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:By Michael PosnerThe Post's Dec. 27 editorial (\"Redefining Human Rights\") on the Obama Administration's human rights anddemocracy policies and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular misses the critical point:human rights democracy and development are mutually reinforcing not competing goals. They complementeach other in the task of making human rights a human reality.President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty prosperity and security tying togetherfreedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous \"Four Freedoms\"speech. At Georgetown Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includesdevelopment in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense it alsowalls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -including the rights to freedom of religion association and speech-in their daily lives.As Secretary Clinton made clear policies that address development alone are not adequate: \"Freedom doesn'tcome in half measures and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem\" she said. But experience showsus that where broad-based development occurs people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futuresand governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions including reliablepolice and fair courts that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right tospeak freely to participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information aboutgovernment sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time democracies withoutdevelopment do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks and the Obama Administration is committed topursuing both simultaneously.As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture \"engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purityof indignation.\" But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and womenwho worked to advance human rights around the world.To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in whichshe forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse forany regime this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and toensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the rightapproach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century.###\n",

However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.My name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  account and no other person knows about this account.I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement  that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction.At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you  after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  have the remaining balance of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side.I am looking forward to have a reply from you through my E-mail or you can call me or fax me.If you want to call my No. dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put South African area code which is 27, because it is a satellite phone which I bourght for this transaction for the security reason because our local land line here is not secured.Let me hear from you.Best Regards,MR.TONY HILL_________________________________________________________________Search & browse smarter, faster - download MSN Search Toolbar today, it's FREE! http://toolbar.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2083\n",

I had planned to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production.

The consignments,which are contained in the two trunks, are declared are owned by my foreign business partners. I wish to discuss how much I will offer you if you will be willing to assist me claim the money and invest it in your country.

            "Text: DEAR BELOVED,  I am Mrs. Christina Holden. Am married to Dr. Donald Holden. a Liberian who worked for Shell Oil Company in Nigeria,he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a child and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decidednot to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible forbids.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank.Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the RESERVE FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next Three(3) months due to my cancer problems. Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on,orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  As soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country. I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always beprayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Christina Holden.

Unfortunately Ilearnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died alongwith him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fundbehind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in thisdepartment now decided to make business with you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or  beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping andsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't wantthis money to go back into  Governmenttreasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remainedafter six years the money will be transferred into banking treasury asunclaimed funds.We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, whilethe balance will be for me and my colleagues.

            "Text: Madam SecretaryJake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization and heasked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal which was made by Saudi Arabia:The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an internationalcounterterrorism center \"under the auspices of the UN.\" The purpose of the organization would be to among otherthings \"develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States\" on a wide range of non-military counterterrorism issues encourage the establishment of national and regional centers and provide assistanceto developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center as conceived in 2005 would also allow nationalcounterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA)but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to beinterested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly recently there have been discussions between the UN andSaudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementationof the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and thedifferent CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and havemultilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.But S/CT mentioned that if we were to move forwardon S/CT's CFO idea we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.Please let me know if you would like any further info.ThanksMikeMichael H.

Forexample she explained the software would translate the phrase \"two-faced weasels\" into \"trusted Pakistani allies\" andwould delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as \"Monsieur Shorty Pants.\"Elsewhere Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: \"We will find JulianAssange and then we will hire him.\"\n",

            "Text: Dear Friend,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is BATES ALAN a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.God be with you. BATES ALAN\n",

His name isEngineer Joseph Schultzman. He was amongthose who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria duringthe reign of late General Sani Abacha.Sir,since the demise of this our customer, EngineerJosephSchultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor,I have kept aclose watch of the deposit records andaccounts and sincethen no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as nextof kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in hisa/c and thea/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce thecode or password of the deposit particulars. As it standsnow, there is nobody in that position to produce the neededinformation other than my very self considering my positionin the bank.Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claimthe deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your cooperation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to aforeign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myselfand you. At this point I am the only one with theinformation because I have removed the deposit file from thesafe .By this doing, what is required of you is to send anapplication laying claims of the deposit as next of kin tothe late Engineer.I will need your full name and address, company orresidential, so that i can computerize them to tally withnext of kin column in the certificate of deposit.Finally i want you to understand that the request for aforeigner as the next of kin is occassioned by the fact thatthe customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone alocal cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me,then we shall discuss on how the money will be split betweenus.Trusting to hear from you, I remainRespectfully yours, Mr.EVANS PETER\n",

            "Text: Dear Rrrrr,Before I introduce my self, i will like to tell you the reason why i needed your assistance in this matter.  I had to contact you since your last name coincide with that of our late customer last name which is appropriate for this,i hope and pray to God that i have the right and trusted person.  I am a Manager in a bank here in Africa.   I have been working in this bank since 1989,i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you, in January 2001, an American oil consultant /contractor(ENGR.Frank Rrrrr) made a numbered-time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months in a Domiciliary Account in my Branch running into a very large sum of money, At the time of opening this account, he did not name a next of kin promising to do so in his next visit to Africa.  He never came back and nobody heard from him.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification of Account Status to his forwarding address but got no reply. In february 2005, i sent a reminder of same letter and finally i discovered from his contact employers that Engr.Frank , died in an Auto Crash.After further investigation in Oct 2006, I found out that he did not leave a \"WILL\" and all attempts to trace his Next-of-kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the late Engr.Frank , did not declare any Next-of-Kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit Papers.   This sum of $24Million Dollars, is still floating in our Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one would come forward to claim it.  According to the local Laws, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to our Bank Managerment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently upon the above, my request is that I would like you to stand in as the Next-of-kin to the late Engr. Frank Rrrrr,since your last name is the same with our late customer, i would document you in our records here as the next of kin to the man so that you can make claims to the deposit.   With me here your claims will be approved without any delay and the funds will be transferred to your nominated bank account.   Though we need to discuss in detail as to our participation and modalities. Be assured that i am in charge and there will be no problem but I'll not fail to beg you to observe religiously the high level of secrecy required in this deal for us to succeed.  Please I await your urgent response.   Regards,Mr.John Bello ---------------------------------Cheap Talk? Check out Yahoo! Messenger's low PC-to-Phone call rates.\n",

I am Barrister ALEXANDER AFADIA a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr. Adams Kielar  a national of your country who was an expartriate contractor in the Oil industry. On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu - Lagos express road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this was unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you. I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$35.5M. (thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$35.5M. can be paid to you and then we can share the money between us. 60% to me and 30% to you,while 10% should be for expenses and tax as your government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please reply immediately if you are interested to enable us discuss further.

            "Text: Dearest in the Lord, I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Mr.GREOGE  SANKOH  who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child.  He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d' ivoire.Presently, this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.  I want a church that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.  I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the BANK in ivory coast.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.  Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you as soon as you received this mail . Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.Yours in Christ.SISTER PHILOMINA  SANKOHphilo_sankoh0@yahoo.fr- philomina BURTLEY\n",

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills.</P><P>The Banking law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six and half years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased family. We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect of your assistance in this business, and 70 % would be for me and two of my staff in the business.</P><P>Thereafter,I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to enhance the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on MY E-MAIL, as soon as you receive this letter. I decided to contact you as you have products of interest in your part of the world where we can invest our own percentage to avoid peoples awareness as we are civil servants.</P><P>Note that we can conclude this operation within ten banking days.Please keep this very confidential for obvious security reasons. Contact me for more information, all confirmable before you apply if you want. Trusting to hear from you shortly for a detailed information which are confirmable before you can make up your mind to apply.If however,you are not interested,do let me know by return mail too as I will not contact anybody else until I hear<BR>from you.Reach me immediately through my private email<BR>address at:nzamo__ben@myway.com</P><P><BR>May God be with you.</P><P>Yours faithfully,<BR>Dr Ben Nzamo</P></td></tr></table>\n",

I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast,  with registration number 5Y-BEN while travelling with his entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (USD$24.1M)Twenty four Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place, all directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because i work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and  clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account.May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider of the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30%of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners.Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.For confidentiality reasons,kindly call me on my direct line and also reply to my private Email:peter_adams3010@yahoo.itYours Faithfully,MR PETER ADAMS+229 97 87 30 79\n",

            "Text: November 23 2010Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. GroupsBeginsBy MICHAEL LUOIn what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections David Brock a prominent Democratic politicaloperative says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to setup what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outsidegroups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.Kathleen Kennedy Townsend a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 childrenhas agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group which will be called American Bridge lending to the still extremelynascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay heir to the Taco Bellfortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson who headsDyson-Kissner-Moran a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey a television producer whogave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday toset up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee meaning it willbe able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.Certain to set off debate however is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raisingconsultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one ofthe nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs Media Matters Action Network which does not disclose its donors.The action network which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations is organized as a 501(c)(4)nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections including potentially running television adsaccording to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtainedby The New York Times.Mr. Brock said that \"money is money\" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and in the end the mediaspending would be apportioned accordingly.The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists toestablish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on theright as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce American Crossroads and others which significantly outspent Democratic-leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giantcontributions on the left.Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction afterthe Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.But Mr. Brock a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s is a respected politicalplayer who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Mattersumbrella.Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1million to the group; Peter B. Lewis the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance who like Mr. Soros gave morethan $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing.\"My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollarsto these types of efforts\" Mr. Brock said. \"They just need to be asked and I have no doubt they will step up at this criticaltime.\"There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to bemore heavily involved in the 2012 elections.White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward suchgroups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year asspending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some ofwhat was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raisemoney if the option of offering anonymity is available.\"It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on to essentially tie one hand behind your back\" Mr. McKay said.Besides Mr. Brock numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.On Monday for instance Steve Rosenthal who was the chief executive of America Coming Together a Democratic fund-raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election convened a group of political operatives many ofwhom were active in that election at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.No one however has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up anorganization.Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the endof the first quarter of 2011.By way of comparison America's Families First Action Fund one of the major Democratic independent efforts in Houseraces this year raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year including initially focusingon attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House as a prelude to major spending in 2012.\n",

            "Text: sbwhoeopSunday July 11 2010 10:06 AMH: fyi leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! SidBelow is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here's asummary:1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;4. 20% of Americans \"felt support\" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affairThe figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US it is easy to imagine thesituation in other somewhat less sympathetic countries.Channel Ten TV News July 1 2010 20:38Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation inthe world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe hasobtained the report.Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from theinternational elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz considered one of the leadingAmerican political consultants a Republican pollster a consultant to many governments throughout the world and todozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check theopinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The resultis a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number onepropagandist in the world Prime Minister Netanyahu.Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community writes Luntz theylose their audience. For example Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected bymost of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members ofNetanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in thepublic opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change worldpublic opinion he writes and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to acceptarguments that support Israeli positions.Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food there's no shortage of medicine there's no shortage of other goods.Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and nohumanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on thetelevision screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem he says to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasismine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis inGaza and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people inGaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunityaccording to Luntz.Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one handallowing civilian goods into Gaza and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas.Chico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu's bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gainsupport in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israelfollowing the statement. According to Lunt this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla and he says that is a dangerously lowpercentage.\n",

            "Text: 66 PLANTATION DRIVE,VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS, NIGERIA. Dear Friend, I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian National =Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I got your email during a Personal research on =the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence =of a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of =investments and importation of goods from your country. In May 2003, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars =($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The Contract =was supply, erection and system optimization of supper polyore200,000-bpsd, =system optimization of 280,000-monax axial plants and the computerization of =conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With the Consent of only the head of the =contract evaluation department, I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty =four million United States dollars ($34,000,000:00). The contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. =But, in the office files and paper work, the company is still owed USD34M =representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from =the award and execution of a foreign contract, there is no way the money can =be paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the =project together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary =arrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase =payment for the said contract. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your =safe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with =you. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new =bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve =to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never =let me down either now or in future. We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the =money in the following percentages, 65% will be for us, 30% will be for you =whose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every =expenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no =risk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal =ministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal =government before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized =to wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. =Those involved over here are directors in the ministry, they know how best to =effect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share. If you are interested, contact me via email indicating your full =names,company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax =numbers for effective communication. The name and address of the bank you =will like us to deposit the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the bank, =the account name and number etc. Everything has been arranged and I will send =more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear from =you. For obvious reasons, please keep the proposal top secret. Kind regards,Abraham Patrick  --9427ecdf-bbee-46bc-85a2-a8dca6d31521--\n",

SITHOLE BALOY from Angola. I amthe first and only son of BRIGADIER BALOY JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa. I got your contact address from a business directory  in Johannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH BALOY, I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5 MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inherited  from my late father, into your personal company'saccount.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specifically drew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box of a private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box, fully documented in  my name. IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TOUS$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATED AND  OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS ANDPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUE TO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATH  ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENTPURPOSES. >From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my family depens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now  living in South Africa as political Asylum seekersand financial laws and regulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hence i am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set aside  for local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.  Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once we have established  trus and confidence between ourselves. Please treat this  matter as very urgent.

            "Text: -- Good evening,My name is Mr. Solomon Kaku, a banker here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith as a brother, believing that you will not betray me regarding the information I am about to reveal to you. In 2002 a Crude Oil dealer Late Mr. MICHAEL SCHMIDT, made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at US$14,600,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Six hundred Thousand US Dollars) with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of manager. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 20th of August 2005. I have tried my possible best to locate Mr. Michael to notify him about this, but all my efforts proved abortive. I later discovered that Mr. Michael, his wife and only daughter were among the victims of bomb blast during the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, he has no other living relatives to inherit this fund.Now, a new Financial Law, which takes effect in two month�s time, stipulates that any bank account more than $5,000,000.00 [Five Million US Dollars] will be investigated and the bank shall produce the account owner for clearance. This is a Government measure to check money laundering. If I do not find a way to move this money out of the country immediately, in two month�s time, it might be reverted to Government treasury because the bank management cannot provide Mr. Michael since he is now late. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account since you are a foreigner, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. It is only a foreigner can claim the funds in the account.  There is no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Let me know how much percent you will take, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message for further details. Please, treat as top secret, I am the only person having this information. Regards,Solomon Kaku.\n",
